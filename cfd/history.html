<h1>The Turbulent History of Fluid Mechanics</h1>

<p>
Naomi Tsafnat</br>
May 17, 1999.</br>
</p>

<p>
It all started with Archimedes, way back in BC, </br>
Who was faced with an interesting problem, you see...
</p>

<p>
The king came to me, and this story he told: </br>
I am not sure if my crown is pure gold. </br>
You are a wise man, or so it is said, </br>
Tell me: is it real, or is it just lead?
</p>

<p>
I paced and I thought, and I scratched my head, </br>
But the answer eluded me, to my dread. </br>
I sat in my bath, and pondered and tried, </br>
And then ... Eureka! Eureka! I found it! I cried.
</p>

<p>
As I sat in my tub and the water was splashing, </br>
I knew suddenly that a force had been acting. </br>
On me in the tub, its proportional, see, </br>
To the water that was where now there is me.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Archimedes caused quite a sensation </br>
But not because of his great revelation; </br>
As he was running through the streets of Syracuse </br>
He didnt notice he was wearing only his shoes.
</p>

<p>
The great Leonardo oh what a fellow </br>
No, not diCaprio, DaVinci I tell you! </br>
He did more than just paint the lovely Mona, </br>
He also studied fluid transport phenomena.
</p>

<p>
Then came Pascal, who clarified with agility, </br>
Basic concepts of pressure transmissibility. </br>
Everyone knows how a barometer looks, </br>
But he figured out just how it works.
</p>

<p>
How can we talk about great scientists, </br>
Without mentioning one of the best: </br>
Sir Isaac Newton, the genius of mathematics, </br>
Also contributed to fluid mechanics.
</p>

<p>
One thing he found, and its easy as pie, </br>
Is that shear stress, ?~D equals Î¼ dv/dy. </br>
His other work, though, was not as successful; </br>
His studies on drag were not all that useful. </br>
He thought he knew how fast sound is sent, </br>
But he was way off, by about twenty percent.
</p>

<p>
And then there was Pitot, with his wonderful tubes, </br>
Which measure how fast an airplane moves. </br>
Poiseuille, dAlembert, Lagrange and Venturi </br>
Through his throats fluid pass in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
Here is another hero of fluid mechanics, </br>
In fact, he invented the word hydrodynamics. </br>
It would take a book to tell you about him fully, </br>
But here is the short tale of Daniel Bernoulli: 
</p>

<p>
Everyone thinks is just one Bernoulli </br>
It is not so! There are many of us, truly. </br>
My family is big, many scientists in this house, </br>
With father Johan, nephew Jacob and brother Nicolaus.
</p>

<p>
But the famous principle is mine, you know, </br>
It tells of the relationship of fluid flow, </br>
To pressure, velocity, and density too. </br>
I also invented the manometer - out of the blue!
</p>

<p>
Yes, Bernoulli did much for fluids, you bet! </br>
He even proposed the use of a jet. </br>
There were others too, all wonderful folks, </br>
Like Lagrange, Laplace, Navier and Stokes.
</p>

<p>
Here is another well-known name, </br>
A mathematician and scientist of great fame: </br>
He is Leonard Euler, Im sure you all know, </br>
His equations are basis for inviscid flow.
</p>

<p>
He did more than introduce the symbols ?~@, I, e, </br>
He also derived the equation of continuity. </br>
And with much thought and keen derivation, </br>
He published the famous momentum equation.
</p>

<p>
Those wonderful equations and diagrams you see? </br>
They are all thanks to Moody, Weisbach and Darcy. </br>
Then there was Mach, and the road that he paves, </br>
After studying the shocking field of shock waves.
</p>

<p>
Rayleigh studied wave motion, and jet instability, </br>
How bubbles collapse, and dynamic similarity. </br>
He was also the first to correctly explain. </br>
Why the sky is blue except when it rains.
</p>

<p>
Osborne Reynolds, whose number we know, </br>
Found out all about turbulent flow. </br>
He also examined with much persistence, </br>
Cavitation, viscous flow, and pipe resistance.
</p>

<p>
In the discovery of the boundary layer </br>
Prandtl was the major player. </br>
Its no wonder that all the scientists say, </br>
He's the father of Modern Fluid Mechanics, hooray!
</p>

<p>
It is because of Prandtl that today we all can </br>
Describe the lift and drag of wings of finite span. </br>
If it werent for him, then the brothers Wright </br>
Would probably never have taken flight.
</p>

<p>
And so we come to the end of this story, </br>
But its not the end of the tales of glory! </br>
The list goes on, and it will grow too </br>
Maybe the next pioneer will be you?
