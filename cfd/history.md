# The Turbulent History of Fluid Mechanics

Naomi Tsafnat<br/>
May 17, 1999.<br/>

It all started with Archimedes, way back in BC, <br/>
Who was faced with an interesting problem, you see...

The king came to me, and this story he told: <br/>
I am not sure if my crown is pure gold. <br/>
You are a wise man, or so it is said, <br/>
Tell me: is it real, or is it just lead?

I paced and I thought, and I scratched my head, <br/>
But the answer eluded me, to my dread. <br/>
I sat in my bath, and pondered and tried, <br/>
And then ... Eureka! Eureka! I found it! I cried.

As I sat in my tub and the water was splashing, <br/>
I knew suddenly that a force had been acting. <br/>
On me in the tub, its proportional, see, <br/>
To the water that was where now there is me.

Of course, Archimedes caused quite a sensation <br/>
But not because of his great revelation; <br/>
As he was running through the streets of Syracuse <br/>
He didnt notice he was wearing only his shoes.

The great Leonardo oh what a fellow <br/>
No, not diCaprio, DaVinci I tell you! <br/>
He did more than just paint the lovely Mona, <br/>
He also studied fluid transport phenomena.

Then came Pascal, who clarified with agility, <br/>
Basic concepts of pressure transmissibility. <br/>
Everyone knows how a barometer looks, <br/>
But he figured out just how it works.

How can we talk about great scientists, <br/>
Without mentioning one of the best: <br/>
Sir Isaac Newton, the genius of mathematics, <br/>
Also contributed to fluid mechanics.

One thing he found, and its easy as pie, <br/>
Is that shear stress, ?~D equals Î¼ dv/dy. <br/>
His other work, though, was not as successful; <br/>
His studies on drag were not all that useful. <br/>
He thought he knew how fast sound is sent, <br/>
But he was way off, by about twenty percent.

And then there was Pitot, with his wonderful tubes, <br/>
Which measure how fast an airplane moves. <br/>
Poiseuille, dAlembert, Lagrange and Venturi <br/>
Through his throats fluid pass in a hurry.

Here is another hero of fluid mechanics, <br/>
In fact, he invented the word hydrodynamics. <br/>
It would take a book to tell you about him fully, <br/>
But here is the short tale of Daniel Bernoulli: 

Everyone thinks is just one Bernoulli <br/>
It is not so! There are many of us, truly. <br/>
My family is big, many scientists in this house, <br/>
With father Johan, nephew Jacob and brother Nicolaus.

But the famous principle is mine, you know, <br/>
It tells of the relationship of fluid flow, <br/>
To pressure, velocity, and density too. <br/>
I also invented the manometer - out of the blue!

Yes, Bernoulli did much for fluids, you bet! <br/>
He even proposed the use of a jet. <br/>
There were others too, all wonderful folks, <br/>
Like Lagrange, Laplace, Navier and Stokes.

Here is another well-known name, <br/>
A mathematician and scientist of great fame: <br/>
He is Leonard Euler, Im sure you all know, <br/>
His equations are basis for inviscid flow.

He did more than introduce the symbols ?~@, I, e, <br/>
He also derived the equation of continuity. <br/>
And with much thought and keen derivation, <br/>
He published the famous momentum equation.

Those wonderful equations and diagrams you see? <br/>
They are all thanks to Moody, Weisbach and Darcy. <br/>
Then there was Mach, and the road that he paves, <br/>
After studying the shocking field of shock waves.

Rayleigh studied wave motion, and jet instability, <br/>
How bubbles collapse, and dynamic similarity. <br/>
He was also the first to correctly explain. <br/>
Why the sky is blue except when it rains.

Osborne Reynolds, whose number we know, <br/>
Found out all about turbulent flow. <br/>
He also examined with much persistence, <br/>
Cavitation, viscous flow, and pipe resistance.

In the discovery of the boundary layer <br/>
Prandtl was the major player. <br/>
Its no wonder that all the scientists say, <br/>
He's the father of Modern Fluid Mechanics, hooray!

It is because of Prandtl that today we all can <br/>
Describe the lift and drag of wings of finite span. <br/>
If it werent for him, then the brothers Wright <br/>
Would probably never have taken flight.

And so we come to the end of this story, <br/>
But its not the end of the tales of glory! <br/>
The list goes on, and it will grow too <br/>
Maybe the next pioneer will be you?
