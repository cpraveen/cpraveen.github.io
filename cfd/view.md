# A one-sided view

*Abstract*: A critical study is made of the tricks of the upwinding trade. Five
lines, it would seem, can describe any scheme of the class that the authors
surveyed.

## 1 Introduction

I said to my darling: "I may go <br>
to meet at U. C. San Diego <br>
the full upwind clan <br>
invited by Stan, <br>
for a boost of the mutual ego.

By often escaping detection <br>
the sun caused no marked defection. <br>
To swim the Pacific <br>
ain't all that terrific <br>
if you must get dry by convection.

## 2 Basic numerical techniques

### 2.1 Conservative difference schemes

Conventional difference equations <br>
give shocks that induce oscillations. <br>
By adding some logic <br>
we get monotonic <br>
numerical representations.

A characteristic equation <br>
when differentiated defies conservation, <br>
which so badly we need. <br>
But at last we were freed <br>
by the grace of Roe's linearization.

To the podium many will hustle <br>
to enter their claim in the tussle. <br>
For the issue is fame <br>
and it seems such a shame <br>
we can't all take credit for MUSCL.

It's really not easy outsmartin' <br>
the TVD schemes of A. Harten. <br>
The name of the game <br>
is they're all the same <br>
so you'd better give up before startin'.

The sight of the slides of the Colella <br>
turns all his competitors yella. <br>
Where others may fail <br>
he's got the detail, <br>
cause the grids are paid for by Ed Teller.

In spite of the entropy glitch <br>
those contracts are making Stan'rich. <br>
He claims Engquist-Osher <br>
is totally kosher <br>
and runs like a son-of-a-bitch.

### 2.2 The state of the art in related areas

The conference could not have been better <br>
except for the following matter: <br>
that out of those listed <br>
some speakers insisted <br>
that they'd give a talk on the weather.

"We all know the problem of Riemann, <br>
the basis of all our schemin'," <br>
This assertion will get <br>
uninitiates upset <br>
and the meteorologists steamin'.

So, medium-term weather prediction <br>
turns out to be merely a fiction. <br>
It's just anyone's guess, <br>
if you ask how to dress <br>
it will offer no useful restriction.

### 2.3 Auxilliary techniques

To sort out a boundary procedure <br>
just talk to this elegant Swede here. <br>
Your results will look nice <br>
in the sense of Heinz Kreiss <br>
and your program may even be speedier.

When exhausted by over-refinin' <br>
don't throw up your hands and start whinin'. <br>
No sense in postponin', <br>
just go for rezonin' <br>
(for details please talk to Mac Hyman).

Approximate factorizations <br>
applied to the Euler equations, <br>
are not all that fast, <br>
in fact, they're surpassed <br>
by classical point relaxations.

Now listen and please do not mock <br>
the spectral technique I'll unlock. <br>
A hundred harmonics <br>
make quite good transonics, <br>
though fifty must die for the shock.

## 3 Theoretical results

Full proofs are exceedingly rare <br>
except in the simple case <br>
the f is convex <br>
in u<sub>t</sub> + f<sub>x</sub> = 0 <br>
such as f = (1/2)u<sup>2</sup>

At dinner on day number three <br>
the cook said to my friend and me: <br>
"You've had burgers enough, <br>
try more variable stuff: <br>
may I offer you eggs and Roe tea?"
