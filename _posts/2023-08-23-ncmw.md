title: Workshop on numerics for hyperbolic problems
layout: post
---

We will be conducting a two-week long workshop on numerical methods for hyperbolic problems, which will cover finite volume, DG and spectral methods.  It is mostly meant for current PhD students but highly motivated master students who have good background in this area and/or are doing some research in this area can also apply.
