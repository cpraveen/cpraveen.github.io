[Boniface Nkonga](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=nczcv-kAAAAJ&hl=fr) is a professor in Univ. of Cote d'Azur, Nice and is also a member of INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis. During his visit, we will try to finish some work on energy consistent schemes for shear shallow water models jointly with Aadi Bhure. 

Boniface works on developing simulation tools for modeling plasma in tokamak-type devices. We are also looking at a new problem of trying to model flow of liquid metals under external magnetic fields and currents by shallow approximations and possibly even with full models where the free-surface is evolved using ALE-type methods. Below is a movie of a mesh movement achieved by solving an elasticity model, which is one ingredient in an ALE-type method.

During his visit, he will also give some research seminars which will be announced later.
