I will be attending the LACAM Conference to be held in IISER Trivandrum during 8-11 December 2025, where I will talk about ongoing work on continuous Galerkin method for compressible flows. This is done joinly with Jalil Khan and N. E. Anil. The conference looks very interesting with a good set of speakers both from India and abroad, mainly Germany.
