Ameya Jagtap from Brown University will be visiting TIFR-CAM during 17 -- 21 October, 2023. He is an expert in physics informed neural networks for PDE governed problems and will be giving a set of four lectures on this topic. The lectures will be in hybrid mode, if you want to attend on Zoom, then write to me for how to watch it.

> Abstract: In recent years, physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) has emerged as a powerful tool to solve many problems in the field of computational science. The main idea of PIDL is to incorporate the governing physical laws into a deep learning framework. The PIDL can smoothly integrate the sparse, noisy, and multi-fidelity data along with the governing equations and thereby recast the original PDE problem into an equivalent optimization problem. This approach has various advantages, including the ability to handle ill-posed inverse problems easily. Furthermore, it is a mesh-free approach and is capable of overcoming the curse of dimensionality. In this mini-workshop, I will cover the fundamentals of deep learning as well as physics-informed deep learning through hands-on coding exercises. I will also discuss some advanced PIDL topics, such as its current capabilities, limitations, and various applications, as this is still an active area of research.
