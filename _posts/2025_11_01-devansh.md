**Title**: Finite Element Method for inductionless MHD problem  
**Date**: 4 Oct 2025  
**Time**: 4 PM IST  
**Venue**: On Zoom

**Abstract**:  
We explore different Finite Element approaches for solving inductionless magnetohydrodynamic (iMHD) problem. We will first analyze different finite element methods for hydrodynamic component (Navier-Stokes equation) and magnetic problem (Darcy-type system) separately. We first consider the magnetic problem and implement two formulations: the continuous Galerkin (CG) and mixed finite element method. These are compared across test cases and benchmarks like accuracy, computational time.
