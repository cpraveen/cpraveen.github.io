A new PhD program in applied and computational mathematics has been started in TIFR, which will be jointly run by CAM and ICTS, both located in Bangalore. Students from math, physics and engineering backgrounds with a master degree who have done some computational work are encouraged to apply.

The admission is focused on certain research areas which are mentioned in the links below. If you would like to work with me, check out my website to see what I do and write to me if you have any questions.
