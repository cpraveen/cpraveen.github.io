Jalil Khan has been granted a National Postdoc Fellowship for two years based on his proposal on continuous Galerkin method for compressible flows. This will allow him to continue his work on this topic where he is exploring the benefits of summation-by-parts schemes that give additional consistency like those on kinetic energy, internal energy and entropy. He is also studying gradient jump penalty as a way to reduce dispersion errors and also act as a subgrid model.
