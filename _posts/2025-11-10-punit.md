**Title**: Positivity of HLL solver for Ten-Moment Model  
**Speaker**: Punit Yadav, Dept. of Mathematics, IIT Delhi  
**Date**: 11 Nov 2025  
**Time**: 4 PM IST  
**Venue**: On Zoom

**Abstract**:
In this presentation, we examine the positivity property of the Harten–Lax–van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ten-moment equations. I outline the structure of the HLL intermediate state, the conditions under which this state remains in the admissible set of positive density and positive-definite pressure, and how these conditions ensure the positivity-preserving property. We'll test this numerically as well for near vacuum problem using first order wave propagation method.
