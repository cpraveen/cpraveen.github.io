[Arpit Babbar](https://www.babbar.dev) defended his doctoral thesis in July 2024 on the topic of high order numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. Arpit has been awarded a Humboldt Research Fellowship for postdocs by the Humboldt Foundation, for his proposal on "Discontinuous Galerkin methods for atmospheric flows". The grant, which is awarded for a period of two years, will allow Arpit to work on topics like development of efficient methods for atmospheric flows, provable admissibility preserving schemes in presence of gravity source terms, optimal temporal discretization and time stepping, and convergence analysis in presence of gravity source terms. Arpit will pursue these research objectives with his academic host [Prof. Hendrik Ranocha](https://ranocha.de) and the Mainz Institute of Multiscale Modeling.
