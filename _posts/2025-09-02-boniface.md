**Abstract**:  We consider a conservative hyperbolic system of dimension 1, 2, and 3. The presentation aims to use a change of variable to recover the well-known 1D HLL Riemann solver. Therefore, we propose a 2D and 3D generalisation of the HLL scheme. The presentation resumes the results of the following published papers.
