Aadi Bhure will be doing his third year project with me. He is an Int-PhD student at TIFR-CAM and holds a bachelor degree in mathematics from Fergusson College, Pune. He will be working on numerical methods for non-conservative hyperbolic systems, and in particular, the shear shallow water model, on which we have done some previous work in our group.
