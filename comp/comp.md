# Computers at TIFR-CAM

We have two good workstations running Linux in our Centre which are listed below. They are located inside the server room and access is by ssh without password, i.e., you need to copy your ssh public keys to these computers. Most of the software are already installed, you can set the path by adding following line to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` file

```bash
. /home/praveen/.setenv
```

Logout and login for the settings to work.

You can ssh into these machines using their hostname or IP number, see below

```shell
ssh -Y euler
```

The extra option `-Y` enables you to get display of some X programs. For example, the document viewer is `evince`

```shell
evince foo.pdf
```
