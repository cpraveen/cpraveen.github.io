## apt commands

Most used commands

To search for a package

```shell
apt-cache search gcc
```

See a description of package

```shell
apt-cache show gcc
```

Install a package

```shell
sudo apt install gcc
```

Remove a package

```shell
sudo apt remove openmpi-bin
```

To upgrade all packages to latest version

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt list --upgradable # check if you really want to upgrade all packages
sudo apt upgrade
```

## Setting the locale

If the locale is not set correctly, you can get weird errors while installing some softwares. Edit the file `/etc/locale.gen` with this line

```text
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
```

and run `sudo locale-gen` command in the terminal.

## Install packages

I use [Spack](comp/spack.html) to install scientific packages. Before that, install some needed dependencies


```shell
sudo apt install gcc g++ gfortran gnuplot make curl wget git vim
```

Essential compilers can also be installed like this

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Next see the [Spack](comp/spack.html) tips for installing other softwares. openmpi will also be installed by Spack, so do not install it from apt.

Install locate

```shell
sudo apt install locate
sudo updatedb
```

To get ifconfig

```shell
sudo apt install net-tools
export PATH=$PATH:/sbin
```
