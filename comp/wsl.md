# WSL

These tips are based on using the Ubuntu version of [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Windows drives (usually called C and D) are available in `/mnt` and you can work in these drives from the Linux command line, but the performance may be bit slow. For example, you can create directories in `D` drive and make symlinks from your home directory under Linux

```shell
cd $HOME
mkdir /mnt/d/Work
ln -s /mnt/d/Work Work
mkdir /mnt/d/Tex
ln -s /mnt/d/Tex Tex
```

In addition, you can create symlinks to some useful Windows folders (replace `USERNAME` with your Windows user name)

```shell
cd $HOME
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Desktop   Desktop
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Documents Documents
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Downloads Downloads
```

In Ubuntu, we install some important programs using `apt`

```shell
sudo apt install gcc gfortran
sudo apt install python                (required by spack)
sudo apt install python3-numpy
sudo apt install python3-scipy
sudo apt install python3-sympy
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
sudo apt install jupyterlab
sudo apt install gnuplot               (install xming)
sudo apt install gv
sudo apt install xpdf
```

and the rest we install using [Spack](comp/spack.html). Other applications can be installed on Windows side, e.g., FileZilla, FireFox, gVim, VisIt, VLC, gmsh, SourceTree, MikTex and VS Code. We can run these Windows programs from the Linux command line by defining some aliases, see sample bashrc file [here](https://github.com/cpraveen/cfdlab/blob/master/bin/bashrc_wsl.txt) which you can add at the end of your `$HOME/.bashrc` file.

For instructios on setting up a WSL development environment, see [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment), and for using VSCode with WSL, see [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).
