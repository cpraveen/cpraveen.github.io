# NCM Workshop on FVSMHP 2023

Numerical examples will require some softwares, and below is a small list.

## If you use Windows

First install WSL and then install packages under WSL.

## Python

To get python and related packages, you should install some distribution of conda. I recommend [miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) but another alternative is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

To install miniforge, download the installer using curl or wget or your favorite program and run the script in a terminal. For eg:

```shell
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

or

```shell
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

Follow the instructions to install. You can do update the base packages

```
conda update -y conda && conda update -y --all
```

And then install few additional packages.

```shell
conda install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib sympy prettytable jupyterlab
```

## Fortran/C/C++

Install gcc compiler using your package manager. For example, using apt on Debian based systems

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
```

should install all the compilers.

## Clawpack

You can just run a shell script to do the installation which requires conda to be already installed.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpraveen/cfdlab/master/bin/clawpack.sh
export CLAW=/path/to/clawpack   # where you want to install clawpack sources
sh ./clawpack.sh v5.9.2
```

You must also set the CLAW variable in your shell configuration file; this is usually `$(HOME)/.bashrc` or `$(HOME)/.zshrc` for bash and zsh shells, respectively.

If you are an expert user, see [here](comp/clawpack.html) for other ways to install.

## Test clawpack

You must activate the claw env before running any clawpack code

```shell
conda activate claw
```

Then

```shell
python $(CLAW)/pyclaw/examples/advection_1d/advection_1d.py iplot=1
```

If this works, start an ipython session and type following there

```python
from clawpack.pyclaw import examples
claw = examples.shock_bubble_interaction.setup()
claw.run()
claw.plot()
```

> WARNING: It is best not to run inside $(CLAW) directory or to modify any code there. You can make a copy of $(CLAW) to some other place and work inside that directory.
