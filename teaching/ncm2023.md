# NCM Workshop on FVSMHP 2023

Numerical examples will require some softwares, and below is a small list.

## If you use Windows

First install WSL and then install packages under WSL.

## Python

To get python and related packages, you should install some distribution of conda. I recommend miniforge but another alternative is Anaconda.

```shell
conda install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib sympy prettytable jupyterlab
```

## Fortran/C/C++

Install gcc compiler using your package manager. For example, using apt on Debian based systems

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
```

should install all the compilers.

## Clawpack

See [here](comp/clawpack.html) for detailed instructions. You can just run a shell script to do the installation which requires conda to be already installed.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpraveen/cfdlab/master/bin/clawpack.sh
export CLAW=/path/to/clawpack   # where you want to install clawpack sources
sh ./clawpack.sh v5.9.2
```
