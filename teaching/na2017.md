## Getting the codes

You can download all the code using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/na
```

This will download all the code inside the directory called <b>na</b>. Alternately, you can download a zip file containing all the code [here](https://github.com/cpraveen/na/archive/master.zip).

You can also read the codes and notebook online [here](http://github.com/cpraveen/na). If you click on any notebook, it will render the notebook. However, you cannot edit but must download the file to your computer and open it locally.

## Starting ipython

ipython is installed on all the computers in the lab. Open a terminal and type the following to start ipython notebook

```shell
