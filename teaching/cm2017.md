# Computational Methods (Jan-May 2017)

**Class timings**: Monday and Thursday, 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM<br/>
**Class room**: Auditorium<br/>
**Grading**: Homework (30), midterm (30), final (40)

## Students

* Ashish Bhole
* Pritam Giri
* Rakesh Kumar
* Ganesh Vaidya (C)

## Class notes

Homework includes class notes. You are expected to take notes in class. By the first class of every week, you must submit your class notes for the previous week. This will be considered for your assessment. The notes must be written with proper sentences and explanations. Any missing or incomplete steps must be filled in full detail.

## Codes

<ol>

<li>
The codes used in the course can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/cpraveen/fem">github</a>. If you use git, you should clone </br> </br>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/fem
</pre>

Alternately, you can download a <a href="https://github.com/cpraveen/fem/archive/master.zip">zip file</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.github.com/cpraveen/fem50" target=_blank>fem50</a>: A Matlab code for 2-d boundary value problem.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.github.com/cpraveen/juliafem" target=_blank>juliafem</a>: Similar to above, but written in Julia language.
</li>

</ol>

## deal.II

The course will make use of [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org) finite element library for numerical demonstration. Please install deal.II on your computer. Detailed instructions on compiling deal.II are given [here](http://www.dealii.org/developer/readme.html). A basic installation can be made following the instructions on the [github page](http://www.github.com/cpraveen/fem). At the time of writing this, the stable version was 8.4.2, which you can download [here](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/releases).

It is recommended to study atleast a few [examples](http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html#list) provided in the deal.II website.
