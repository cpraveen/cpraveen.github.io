## Assignments

Assignments must be ideally done individually without discussing with others. You can discuss with the TA.

It is **highly recommended** to write the assignment in LaTeX [1,2]. You can install LaTeX on your laptop and use [TexStudio](http://www.texstudio.org) as a LaTeX editor. Or use the free online tool [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) which works in the browser and does not require any installation. Another very good software for writing mathematical documents is [Texmacs](http://www.texmacs.org).

If you write assignments by hand, then they must be written on standard A4 size paper only. There must be a margin of about 1 inch drawn on left of front-side and a corresponding margin on right of back-side, together with a margin on top of every page. Write assignment number, your full name and date of submission. Cleanliness and clarity in writing will carry weightage while grading.

Assignments can also be written in the form of jupyter notebook where you can use LaTeX.

Assignments should be submitted on Google Classroom. If it is handwritten, then scan it and submit the pdf.

File names must contain assignment number and your name, in this format: `Assign_1_YourName.pdf` or `Assign_1_YourName.ipynb`. Do not use spaces in file names.

Most of the examples codes given will be in Python. You are encouraged to write coding assignments in Python, but you are free to use other languages like C/C++/Python/Matlab/Julia.

Here are some tips on writing assignment and exam.

1. Explain how you will make the grid along with the numbering of grid points. A figure will be very useful.
1. Dont just write down the equations of the numerical method, explain how you arrive at them.
1. For coding assignments, after you obtain the numerical result, make some conclusions from the results. How good is the solution, are there any problems with it, does it agree with the theoretical analysis of the method, etc.

## Intro to Python

A small introduction to some Python that is useful for this course is available [here](https://github.com/cpraveen/python). You can clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/python
cd python
```

or download a [zip file](https://github.com/cpraveen/python/archive/master.zip), or

```shell
wget https://github.com/cpraveen/python/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd python-master
```

## Codes: finite difference and finite volume

<ol>

<li>
Finite difference/volume codes used in the course can be obtained from the following urls: <a href="https://github.com/cpraveen/numpde">numpde</a>. If you use git, you should clone </br>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/numpde
cd numpde
</pre>

Alternately, you can download a <a href="https://github.com/cpraveen/numpde/archive/master.zip">zip file</a>, or

<pre>

## deal.II

The course will make use of [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org) finite element library for numerical demonstration. Please install deal.II on your computer. Detailed instructions on compiling deal.II are given [here](http://www.dealii.org/developer/readme.html). A basic installation can be made following the instructions on the [github page](https://github.com/cpraveen/fem/tree/master/deal.II). At the time of writing this, the stable version was 9.3.2, which you can download [here](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/releases).

It is recommended to study atleast a few [examples](http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html#list) provided in the deal.II website.

deal.II is installed on all the lab computers. Add following line to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` file

```shell
. /home/praveen/.setvars.sh
```

logout and login again for this to take effect. You can test that deal.II is working correctly by running an example code.

```shell
mkdir $HOME/deal.II
cd $HOME/deal.II
cp -r $DEAL_II_DIR/share/deal.II/examples .
cd examples/step-1
cmake .
make
./step-1
```

Running the step-1 program should produce the following output and two eps files

```text
Grid written to grid-1.eps
Grid written to grid-2.eps
```

There is no single text for this course, but many references are listed in the syllabus. Due to this reason, you are **strongly encouraged** to take down notes in class.
