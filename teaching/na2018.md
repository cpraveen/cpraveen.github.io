## Introduction to Python

You can get the notebooks using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/python
```

This will download all the code inside the directory called <b>python</b>. Alternately, you can download a zip file containing all the code [here](https://github.com/cpraveen/python/archive/master.zip)

You can also read the codes and notebook online [here](http://github.com/cpraveen/python). If you click on any notebook, it will render the notebook. However, you cannot edit the notebook but must download the file to your computer and open it locally.

## Getting the codes

You can download all the code using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/na
```

This will download all the code inside the directory called <b>na</b>. Alternately, you can download a zip file containing all the code [here](https://github.com/cpraveen/na/archive/master.zip).

You can also read the codes and notebook online [here](http://github.com/cpraveen/na). If you click on any notebook, it will render the notebook. However, you cannot edit but must download the file to your computer and open it locally.

## Using notebooks

Python is installed on all the computers in the lab. Open a terminal and type the following to start a notebook

```shell
jupyter-notebook
```

This should start the notebook in your web browser.

## Microsoft Azure Notebooks

You can make an account on [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com) and create a notebook and run in your browser.

On my Azure account, you can see the [Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/cpraveen/libraries/python) and [numerical codes](https://notebooks.azure.com/cpraveen/libraries/numa). **Note that these are copies of the codes on my github account and may be slightly older, though I try to sync them periodically**.
