# NCM Workshop on Numerical Methods for PDE

The workshop will be held during 16--27 December 2024 at IIPE, Visakhapatnam.

[https://www.atmschools.org/school/2024/NCMW/nmpde](https://www.atmschools.org/school/2024/NCMW/nmpde)

I will be giving some lectures on Discontinuous Galerkin methods for conservation laws. This page gives some resources for attending these lectures.

## Codes for lectures

The codes will be written in C++ using [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org) library.  The codes can be read here: [fem](https://github.com/cpraveen/fem)

Download them using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/fem
```

Many of these codes are still being made and updated, so you should download them frequently to get the latest version. E.g., using git

```shell
cd fem
git pull
```

The DG codes are in the sub-directories `dg1d` and `dg2d`. See the readme files and follow the instructions.

## Installing deal.II

For optimal experience, use Linux or MacOS; if you are on Windows, then you must install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and install/work inside that.

You must have deal.II installed and working in order to run these codes. Instructions on how to install are given here

[Installing deal.II](https://github.com/cpraveen/fem/blob/master/deal.II/README.md#installing-dealii)

For most users, it is recommended to use Docker or the "Automated installation" process. Expert users can consider installation using [spack](https://cpraveen.github.io/comp/spack.html).

If you use Docker, you can also install deal.II through that which gives you a full installation of deal.II with all external dependencies.

## Learning C++ and deal.II

The example codes are in C++ and use many things like classes, templates, inheritence, etc. So a good knowledge of C++ is necessary for understand these codes. The following books are good resources for C++

1. Bjarne Stroustrup, A Tour of C++
1. Peter Gottschling, Discovering Modern C++: An Intensive Course for Scientists,  Engineers and Programmers

In addition, the [deal.II tutorials](https://dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html) have an excellent description of both FEM and C++, and you will benefit by studying a few of the initial steps.
