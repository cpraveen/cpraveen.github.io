# NCM Workshop on Numerical Methods for PDE

https://www.atmschools.org/school/2024/NCMW/nmpde

I will be giving some lectures on Discontinuous Galerkin methods for conservation laws. This page gives some resources for attending these lectures.

## Codes for lectures

The codes will be written in C++ using [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org) library.  The codes can be read here: [fem](https://github.com/cpraveen/fem)

Download them using git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpraveen/fem
```

Many of these codes are still being made and updated, so you should download them frequently to get the latest version. E.g., to update chpde codes

```shell
cd fem
git pull
```

The DG codes are in the directories `fem/dg1d/deal.II` and `dg2d`. See the readme files and follow the instructions.

## Installing deal.II

For optimal experience, use Linux or MacOS; if you are on Windows, then you must install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and install/work inside that.

You must have deal.II installed and working in order to run these codes. Instructions on how to install are given here

https://github.com/cpraveen/fem/blob/master/deal.II/README.md#installing-dealii

For most users, it is recommended to use the "Automated installation" process. Expert users can consider installation using [spack](https://cpraveen.github.io/comp/spack.html).
